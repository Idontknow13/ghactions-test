Testing publishing releases and working with Github Actions.

## About

This repository contains a CLI application that screams at you using a certain amount of characters that you provide [see `Usage`]. Everytime a release tag is committed, the application will be built into a Linux x86-64 binary via Github Actions. The build artifacts should be inside the tag and downloadable as necessary.

## Usage

`scream 100` : screams using 100 characters.
